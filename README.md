## About The Project
This project was developed by using express and inquirer. Express was used to to create our database. The database stores the actions a player can make, along with what the player can use to move along in their escape from space. It also provides the prompts for the player so they can make choices and directs the player to the next prompt based on the choice they make for their survival.
