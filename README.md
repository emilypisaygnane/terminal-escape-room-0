## About The Project

This game was developed by incorporating a series of technologies such as Express, PostgresSQL, and Inquirer NPM Package. Each of the prompts are linked to a series of actions to choose from. Upon choosing a specific action, the player is then led to another prompt with its corresponding set of actions and so on. Within the game, we also incorporated some barriers that rely on specific game conditions to be met in order for the player to achieve their desired goals.
